### Introduction 
---
"I'll read it when I get time". 
"I really need to read that one when I get the chance"
"Once I finish this one, I will read THAT one."
"I need to add that book to my list!"

Um..what list? 

The problem is, you don't actually have a list. Until now. 

Book Buddy will keep track off all the books you've read or want to read. Simple and effective, its the app that you will actually want to use. 

### Technologies 
---
HTML/CSS(Using grid and flexbox)/Javascript

### Features 
---
* Clean interface allows you to quickly add, delete or mark books as read.
* Books appear on neatly formatted cards to make it easy to understand where you are in your reading.

### Inspiration 
---
I've always loved the functionality and clarity of the spotify interface. I borrowed just a bit from its desktop app.  This app was created for The Odin Project.
